# automated-bar-using-ABB-robot
As my final high school project, I developed an automated drink preparation system composed of three main components: a mobile application, a “bar-box” control unit, and an ABB GoFa collaborative robot.

The goal was to automate the drink-making process in restaurants and bars. The operator takes customer orders and selects the corresponding table using a mobile app built with MIT App Inventor. The app sends the order to the bar-box, which processes the request and instructs the robot to pick up a glass and place it under a dispensing system.

Once the glass is correctly positioned, the bar-box starts the drink dispensing process. When the drink is ready, the robot moves the glass to a drop-off station.

To improve the system’s efficiency and safety, various features were added — including examples like distance sensors to detect the presence of drinks in specific locations, and a basic memory and queuing system to handle multiple orders at once.

This project integrates robotics, automation, and mobile development to demonstrate a practical application of Industry 4.0 concepts in the hospitality sector.
